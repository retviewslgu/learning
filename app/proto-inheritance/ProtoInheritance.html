<div ng-controller="ProtoInheritanceCtrl">

        <p>
        Scope inheritance is normally straightforward, and you often don't even need to know it is happening... until
        you try 2-way data binding (i.e., form elements, ng-model) to a primitive (e.g., number, string, boolean)
        defined on the parent scope from inside the child scope. It doesn't work the way most people expect it should
        work. What happens is that the child scope gets its own property that hides/shadows the parent property of the
        same name. This is not something AngularJS is doing â€“ this is how JavaScript prototypal inheritance works. New
        AngularJS developers often do not realize that ng-repeat, ng-switch, ng-view, ng-include and ng-if all create
        new child scopes, so the problem often shows up when these directives are involved. (See this example for a
        quick illustration of the problem.)

        <h3>Using primitive:</h3>

        <div class="example">

                <img class="mainImg" ng-src="{{mainImgUrl}}"/>

                <p>This is the parent scope with the main image.</p>

                <p>$scope.mainImgUrl == {{mainImgUrl}}</p>

                <div class="thumbsProto">

                        <p>Thumbs generated with ng-repeat, with ng-click setting <strong>$scope.mainImgUrl</strong>
                                (click on them to see what happens):</p>

                        <div class="thumbDivProto" ng-repeat="img in images">

                                <img class="thumbProto" ng-src="{{img}}" ng-click="mainImgUrl = img"/>

                                <p>This is a child scope generated by ng-repeat.</p>

                                <p>$scope.mainImgUrl == {{mainImgUrl}}</p>

                        </div>

                </div>

        </div>


        <h3>Using object:</h3>

        <div class="example">

                <img class="mainImg" ng-src="{{mainImg.url}}"/>

                <p>This is the parent scope with the main image.</p>

                <p>$scope.mainImg.url == {{mainImg.url}}</p>

                <div class="thumbsProto">

                        <p>Thumbs generated with ng-repeat, with ng-click setting <strong>$scope.mainImg.url</strong>
                                (click on them to see what happens):</p>

                        <div class="thumbDivProto" ng-repeat="img in images">

                                <img class="thumbProto" ng-src="{{img}}" ng-click="mainImg.url = img"/>

                                <p>This is a child scope generated by ng-repeat.</p>

                                <p>$scope.mainImg.url == {{mainImg.url}}</p>

                        </div>

                </div>

        </div>
</div>
